### Become a member of the organization ‚≠ê

Steps to onboard you üë£ 

1. **You** sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup, it's free. Read https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct for selecting your GitHub name. When you already have a GitHub account, you can use this. Consider signing up for GitHub Education, it can give you a free GitHub Copilot subscription. 
2. **You** enter your GitHub name in this [Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=PpeO9wtcuEq715iHyVqOvWY2_0g0xmdMnWy3R6Eqe89UN1NSSFNGQ0tWOFpYWVNFOEo4VzdVWTJaSi4u) (The form is accessible with your Constructor University Credentials, only users related to the courses will be accepted.)
3. **Instructors** will invite you to this GitHub organization. (You have to wait until this is done. Then GitHub will send you the invitation by email to the address you registered your GitHub account with.)
4. **You** have to accept the invitation which comes with an email from GitHub
5. Now, you can access all repositories that will be created from your practice in this organization!

**Please do the registration as soon as possible, because you see there is an intermediate step, where the instructors need to do something until you receive the invitation email from Github.**
